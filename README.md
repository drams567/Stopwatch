**Utility class for modularly measuring runtime within c++ applications.**
<br>
Ideologically works as a regular stopwatch with commands to start, stop, reset, and read.
<br>
Uses include:
<ul>
  <li>Modularizing/organizing runtime measurement into the overall time taken by individual components, classes, and processes.</li>
  <li>Discluding uncontrollable factors, such as user input, from runtime measurement.</li>
  <li>Singling out areas undergoing optimization.</li>
</ul>
